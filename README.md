## About Me

I am an experienced software engineer, passionate about building solutions that create value for organizations.

In my career I’ve worked as a software developer, development team lead, and application development manager. In my current role as an application architect, I provide designs, prototypes, patterns, standards, and mentoring for my team members and organization.

I am most experienced with the Microsoft ecosystem, particularly .NET (Core and Framework) web and Windows applications with SQL Server databases. Additionally, I enjoy learning new technologies as needs and opportunities arise.

I enjoy practicing and advocating for SOLID design principles, as well as DevOps disciplines.
