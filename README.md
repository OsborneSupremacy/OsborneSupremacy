## About Me

I am an experienced software engineer, passionate about building solutions that create value for organizations.

In my career I’ve worked as a software developer, development team lead, and application development manager. In my current role as a software architect, I provide architectural designs, prototypes, patterns, standards, and mentoring for my team members and organization.

I enjoy practicing and advocating for SOLID design principles, as well as DevOps disciplines.
